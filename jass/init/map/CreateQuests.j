In order to stay alive, you must keep all 3 of your stats above 0.

Eating food is a way to keep your health up.  To get food you must kill an animal and pick up its raw meat. Drop the raw meat by a fire and use the fire's cook ability.

He levels the fastest and is thusly good at early game attacks.
Trackers works well against thiefs.

call CreateQuestBJ( bj_QUESTTYPE_OPT_DISCOVERED, "Beastmaster Tips", "Beast master has random base damage and can hit for more than a same level hunter, or for as much as a gatherer.
Beast master when subclassed is good at running enemies down.
As beast master sometimes its better to kill your own animals for exp rather than let enemies potentially kill them and level off them.
", "ReplaceableTextures\\CommandButtons\\BTNShaman.blp" )

call CreateQuestBJ( bj_QUESTTYPE_OPT_DISCOVERED, "Gatherer Tips", "Gatherer is very slow and weak while unsubclassed.
He has one of the worst attack speeds, but when subclassed it increases to normal.
Gatherers are usually in charge of establishing a base while others hunt, but later on they can use items to solo hunt and level pretty fast.
Also they can get ships to level off panthers and other island coastal hostiles.

call CreateQuestBJ( bj_QUESTTYPE_OPT_DISCOVERED, "Mage Tips", "The mage is good for fighting melee opponents.
He has many powerful spells but he runs out of energy fast.
Sometimes it is good to carry Mana potions on you.
The mages base damage is relativley high, but he has bad attack speed.
He is a good leveler and can use Mage fire to cook food on the spot.

Priests have low base damage and attack speed, but attack speed normalizes when hes subclassed.
Taking into account of the glow and pump up, Priests can actually have the fastest attack speed.
The effectivness of most of the Priest's spells go to helping allies.

There are also Scout's Bushes which only he can get to.
Observer can be used to mine your base, or to keep an eye on key areas.
